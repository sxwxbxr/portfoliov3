## Overview

This repository will stay in sync with your deployed chats on [v0.app](https://v0.app).
Any changes you make to your deployed app will be automatically pushed to this repository from [v0.app](https://v0.app).

## Deployment

Your project is live at:

**[https://www.sweber.dev](https://www.sweber.dev)**

## Translation configuration

The in-app language selector uses on-demand translation requests. Configure the following environment variables when deploying:

- `LIBRE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY` – API key for your LibreTranslate instance (required to enable automatic machine translation).
- `LIBRE_TRANSLATE_ENDPOINT` – optional custom endpoint if you host your own LibreTranslate server. Defaults to `https://libretranslate.com/translate`.

Without an API key the UI will fall back to curated translations for common interface elements and keep English content for everything else.

## Build your app

Continue building your app on:

**[https://v0.app/chat/projects/tLJ14Pyvivh](https://v0.app/chat/projects/tLJ14Pyvivh)**

## How It Works

1. Create and modify your project using [v0.app](https://v0.app)
2. Deploy your chats from the v0 interface
3. Changes are automatically pushed to this repository
4. Vercel deploys the latest version from this repository
